# AI-Text-Summarizer-Hugging-API-
This is a project build using the hugging face api , html , css and javascript in the bootcamp of GeeksforGeeks API Bootcamp: Summer Edition - Sponsored by Postman
This project involves building an AI-powered text summarizer using the Hugging Face API, deployed on the Replit platform. The AI summarizer leverages state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) models, such as BART or T5, to automatically generate concise summaries of long text. 

The project is structured as follows:
1. Hugging Face API: Utilizes pre-trained summarization models from the Hugging Face Model Hub to process and summarize text. 
2. Replit Platform: Replit is used as the development and hosting environment. It allows for easy integration of Python libraries like `transformers`, enabling seamless interaction with the Hugging Face API.
3. Summarization Workflow: The text input is processed by the Hugging Face summarization model, which then returns a shorter version of the original content, preserving key information.
4. Optional Web Interface: The project can include a web interface using HTML CSS and JavaScript, where users can input text and receive a summary via a simple API.

This setup provides an accessible and efficient way for users to summarize large amounts of text using cutting-edge AI technology, with minimal setup or infrastructure required.
